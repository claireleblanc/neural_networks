## Project Proposal: Using Neural Networks to Predict Cross Country and Track Race Times

### Project Description

Cross country and track races and governed by a miriad of factors, such that it is impossible to predict exactly what will happen. On one weekend, one person will win, and the next weekend, with almost the exact same competitiors and course, someone else will come out victorious. Despite the difficult posed in predicting races, there is no shortage of attempts, and many runners spend hours pouring over race results and prediction websites. 

This project will train neural networks to predict the results of a race using previous race results from a variety of courses, weather conditions, time of day, etc. While there will always be uncertainty in races, this project could help people to set achievable goals, metally prepare for race day, and see if there are any hidden factors influencing race results. 

### Project Goals

- Train a neural network to predict the results of a cross country or track race of a specific distance
- Expand the NN to perdict the results of races of any distance
- Determine if there are any hidden factors that influence race results
- Explore the ethical implications of these sorts of predictions, and how this could change the sport
